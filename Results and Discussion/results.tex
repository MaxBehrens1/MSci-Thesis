\section{Results and Discussion}

\subsection{hBN in the Absence of a Cavity}

This section presents the optical characterisation of two single-photon emitters identified in hBN flakes. Each emitter was analysed to assess its suitability for quantum photonic applications. The characterisation includes measurements of the emission spectrum, $g^{(2)}(\tau)$, saturation behaviour, and lifetime.

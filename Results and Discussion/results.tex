\section{Results and Discussion}

\subsection{hBN in the Absence of a Cavity}

Choose 2/3 defects and include all the following

\subsubsection{Emitter Characteristics}

1) Include big 2x2 graphic with lifetime, spectrum, g2(0), Saturation Curve.

\subsubsection{Power and Filter Dependent Dephasing Rate}

2) Visibility against time-delay (dephasing rate)




\subsection{Cavity Measurements}

\subsubsection{k-Space and Newton Ring Characterisation}

\subsubsection{Reflectivity Measurements}



\subsection{Integration of hBN Emitters with an Open Fabry–Pérot Cavity}

Explain the limitations of why we were not able to do this

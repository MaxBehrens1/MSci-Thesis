  abstract = {The growing maturity of integrated photonic technology makes it possible to build increasingly large and complex photonic circuits on the surface of a chip. Today, most of these circuits are designed for a specific application, but the increase in complexity has introduced a generation of photonic circuits that can be programmed using software for a wide variety of functions through a mesh of on-chip waveguides, tunable beam couplers and optical phase shifters. Here we discuss the state of this emerging technology, including recent developments in photonic building blocks and circuit architectures, as well as electronic control and programming strategies. We cover possible applications in linear matrix operations, quantum information processing and microwave photonics, and examine how these generic chips can accelerate the development of future photonic circuits by providing a higher-level platform for prototyping novel optical functionalities without the need for custom chip fabrication.},

  abstract = {Classical interferometry works by detecting correlations in the phases of two waves. In Nature in 1956, R. Hanbury-Brown and R. Q. Twiss demonstrated another technique that probes quantum-mechanical correlations in the electromagnetic field. Splitting an incoherent light beam, they found that photon detections in the two daughter beams were correlated: the photons were bunching together. This corresponds to a correlation in the intensity of light in the two beams, which Hanbury-Brown and Twiss suggested could be used to infer the angular size of distant stars. Physicists now rely on the effect to probe the quantum character of complex light sources. [Obituary of Robert Hanbury Brown: Nature 416, 34 (2002)]},

  abstract = {In this review, the current landscape of emergent quantum materials for quantum photonic applications is described. The review focuses on three specific solid-state platforms: single emitters in monolayers of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), defects in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), and colloidal quantum dots in perovskites (PQDs). These platforms share a unique technological accessibility, enabling the rapid implementation of testbed quantum applications, all while being on the verge of becoming technologically mature enough for a first generation of real-world quantum applications. The review begins with a comprehensive overview of the current state-of-the-art for relevant single-photon sources in the solid-state, introducing the most important performance criteria and experimental characterization techniques along the way. Progress for each of the three novel materials is then benchmarked against more established (yet complex) platforms, highlighting performance, material-specific advantages, and giving an outlook on quantum applications. This review will thus provide the reader with a snapshot on latest developments in the fast-paced field of emergent single-photon sources in the solid-state, including all the required concepts and experiments relevant to this technology.},

We detail its hardware and post-processing. We analyse the hardware for known implementation loopholes, search for possible new loopholes, and discuss countermeasures.

  abstract = {The original proposal of quantum key distribution (QKD) was based on ideal single photon sources, which 40 years later, are still challenging to develop. Therefore, the development of decoy state protocols using weak coherent states (WCS) from lasers, set the frontier in terms of secure key rates. Here, we propose and experimentally emulate two simple-to-implement protocols that allow practical, far from ideal sub-Poissonian photon sources to outperform state-of-the-art WCS. By engineering the photon statistics of a quantum dot's biexciton-exciton cascade, we show that either a truncated decoy state protocol or a heralded purification protocol can be employed to achieve a significantly increased performance in terms of the maximal allowed channel loss for secure key creation, which can exceed that of WCS by more than 3dB. We then show that our recently demonstrated room temperature single photon sources, based on giant colloidal quantum dots coupled to nano-antennas, are already well within the optimal performance range. These protocols can be utilized efficiently on a host of various sub-Poissonian quantum emitters having controllable photon statistics, offering a practical approach to QKD without the hindering requirements on the single photon purity of the photon source.},

A prominent example is secure communication, i.e., the task of transmitting confidential messages from one location to another. The cryptographic requirement here is that the transmitted messages remain inaccessible to anyone other than the designated recipients, even if the communication channel is untrustworthy. In classical cryptography, this can usually be guaranteed only under computational hardness assumptions, such as when factoring large integers is infeasible. In contrast, the security of quantum cryptography relies entirely on the laws of quantum mechanics. Here this physical notion of security is reviewed, with a focus on quantum key distribution and secure communication.},

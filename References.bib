  abstract = {Photon-number-splitting (PNS) is a well-known theoretical attack on quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols that employ weak coherent states produced by attenuated laser pulses. However, beyond the fact that it has not yet been demonstrated experimentally, its plausibility and effect on quantum bit error rate are questioned. In this work, an experimental scheme is presented for PNS attack employing demonstrated technological capabilities, specifically a single-photon Raman interaction (SPRINT) in a cavity-enhanced three-level atomic system. Several aspects of the proposed implementation are addressed, analytically and simulatively, and the eavesdropper's information gain by the attack is calculated. Furthermore, it is analytically shown that the scheme results in a small (yet non-zero) quantum bit error rate, and a comparison to purely theoretical analyses in the literature is presented. It is believed that the inherent nonlinearity of the PNS attack unavoidably affects the optical modes sent to the receiver, and accordingly will always result in some error rate.},

Today, most of these circuits are designed for a specific application, but the increase in complexity has introduced a generation of photonic circuits that can be programmed using software for a wide variety of functions through a mesh of on-chip waveguides, tunable beam couplers and optical phase shifters. Here we discuss the state of this emerging technology, including recent developments in photonic building blocks and circuit architectures, as well as electronic control and programming strategies. We cover possible applications in linear matrix operations, quantum information processing and microwave photonics, and examine how these generic chips can accelerate the development of future photonic circuits by providing a higher-level platform for prototyping novel optical functionalities without the need for custom chip fabrication.},

Site positioning progress has been made in established platforms including defects in diamond and self-assembled quantum dots, albeit often with compromised coherence and optical quality. The emergence of single quantum emitters in layered transition metal dichalcogenide semiconductors offers new opportunities to construct a scalable quantum architecture. Here, using nanoscale strain engineering, we deterministically achieve a two-dimensional lattice of quantum emitters in an atomically thin semiconductor. We create point-like strain perturbations in mono- and bi-layer WSe2 which locally modify the band-gap, leading to efficient funnelling of excitons towards isolated strain-tuned quantum emitters that exhibit high-purity single photon emission. We achieve near unity emitter creation probability and a mean positioning accuracy of 120±32\,nm, which may be improved with further optimization of the nanopillar dimensions.},

Twiss demonstrated another technique that probes quantum-mechanical correlations in the electromagnetic field. Splitting an incoherent light beam, they found that photon detections in the two daughter beams were correlated: the photons were bunching together. This corresponds to a correlation in the intensity of light in the two beams, which Hanbury-Brown and Twiss suggested could be used to infer the angular size of distant stars. Physicists now rely on the effect to probe the quantum character of complex light sources. [Obituary of Robert Hanbury Brown: Nature 416, 34 (2002)]},

To overcome this limit, degenerate spontaneous Four-Wave-Mixing is a reliable technique which combines two pump photons into a pair of signal and idler photons via Kerr nonlinear optical effect. By exploiting the intrinsic small confinement volume and thermally tuning the resonances of a 20 μm-long Photonic Crystal cavity, we efficiently generate time-energy entangled photon pairs and heralded single photons at a large maximum on-chip rate of 22 MHz, using 36 μW of pump power. We measure time-energy entanglement with net visibility up to 96.6 \% using 1 second integration time constant. Our measurements demonstrate the viability of Photonic Crystal cavities to act as an alternative and efficient photon pair source for quantum photonics.},

  abstract = {Deterministic generation of single photons is essential for many quantum information technologies. A bulk optical nonlinearity emitting a photon pair, where the measurement of one of the photons heralds the presence of the other, is commonly used with the caveat that the single-photon emission rate is constrained due to a trade-off between multiphoton events and pair emission rate. Using an efficient and low noise photon-number-resolving superconducting nanowire detector we herald, in real time, a single photon at telecommunication wavelength. We perform a second-order photon correlation 𝑔2⁡(0) measurement of the signal mode conditioned on the measured photon number of the idler mode for various pump powers and demonstrate an improvement of a heralded single-photon source. We develop an analytical model using a phase-space formalism that encompasses all multiphoton effects and relevant imperfections, such as loss and multiple Schmidt modes. We perform a maximum-likelihood fit to test the agreement of the model to the data and extract the best-fit mean photon number 𝜇 of the pair source for each pump power. A maximum reduction of 0.118 ±0.012 in the photon 𝑔2⁡(0) correlation function at 𝜇 =0.327 ±0.007 is obtained, indicating a strong suppression of multiphoton emissions. For a fixed 𝑔2⁡(0) =7 ×10−3, we increase the single pair generation probability by 25\%. Our experiment, built using fiber-coupled and off-the-shelf components, delineates a path to engineering ideal sources of single photons.},

Here, we present the first realization of a truncated Gaussian-shaped microcavity coupled to a QD. The implementation is based on wet-chemical etching and epitaxial semiconductor overgrowth. The cavity modes and their spatial profiles are experimentally studied and agree well with simulations. The fundamental mode wavelength with Q-factors around 6000 and a small polarization splitting of 29\,μeV can be reproducibly controlled via fabrication design, enabling the adaption of the cavity to a specific QD. Finally, transitions of a QD inside a cavity are tuned on and off resonance via temperature tuning. A reduced decay time by a factor above 3 on resonance clearly indicates Purcell enhancement while second-order correlation measurements of g(2)(0)\,=\,0.057 prove that the QDs single-photon characteristic is preserved.},

The review focuses on three specific solid-state platforms: single emitters in monolayers of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), defects in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), and colloidal quantum dots in perovskites (PQDs). These platforms share a unique technological accessibility, enabling the rapid implementation of testbed quantum applications, all while being on the verge of becoming technologically mature enough for a first generation of real-world quantum applications. The review begins with a comprehensive overview of the current state-of-the-art for relevant single-photon sources in the solid-state, introducing the most important performance criteria and experimental characterization techniques along the way. Progress for each of the three novel materials is then benchmarked against more established (yet complex) platforms, highlighting performance, material-specific advantages, and giving an outlook on quantum applications. This review will thus provide the reader with a snapshot on latest developments in the fast-paced field of emergent single-photon sources in the solid-state, including all the required concepts and experiments relevant to this technology.},

An example of such an optical source is a single-photon pulse with a vanishing probability for detecting two or more photons. Using pulsed laser excitation of a single quantum dot, a single-photon turnstile device that generates a train of single-photon pulses was demonstrated. For a spectrally isolated quantum dot, nearly 100\% of the excitation pulses lead to emission of a single photon, yielding an ideal single-photon source.}

Therefore, the development of decoy state protocols using weak coherent states (WCS) from lasers, set the frontier in terms of secure key rates. Here, we propose and experimentally emulate two simple-to-implement protocols that allow practical, far from ideal sub-Poissonian photon sources to outperform state-of-the-art WCS. By engineering the photon statistics of a quantum dot's biexciton-exciton cascade, we show that either a truncated decoy state protocol or a heralded purification protocol can be employed to achieve a significantly increased performance in terms of the maximal allowed channel loss for secure key creation, which can exceed that of WCS by more than 3dB. We then show that our recently demonstrated room temperature single photon sources, based on giant colloidal quantum dots coupled to nano-antennas, are already well within the optimal performance range. These protocols can be utilized efficiently on a host of various sub-Poissonian quantum emitters having controllable photon statistics, offering a practical approach to QKD without the hindering requirements on the single photon purity of the photon source.},

However, the required cryogenic temperatures for the functionality of these sources has been an inhibitor of their full potential. Existing methods to create emitters in 2D materials face fundamental challenges in extending the working temperature while maintaining the emitter’s fabrication yield and purity. In this work, we demonstrate a method of creating site-controlled single-photon emitters in atomically thin WSe2 with high yield utilizing independent and simultaneous strain engineering via nanoscale stressors and defect engineering via electron-beam irradiation. Many of the emitters exhibit biexciton cascaded emission, single-photon purities above 95\%, and working temperatures up to 150\,K. This methodology, coupled with possible plasmonic or optical micro-cavity integration, furthers the realization of scalable, room-temperature, and high-quality 2D single- and entangled-photon sources.},

A prominent example is secure communication, i.e., the task of transmitting confidential messages from one location to another. The cryptographic requirement here is that the transmitted messages remain inaccessible to anyone other than the designated recipients, even if the communication channel is untrustworthy. In classical cryptography, this can usually be guaranteed only under computational hardness assumptions, such as when factoring large integers is infeasible. In contrast, the security of quantum cryptography relies entirely on the laws of quantum mechanics. Here this physical notion of security is reviewed, with a focus on quantum key distribution and secure communication.},

We show that the linewidths of hBN quantum emitters are phonon broadened, even at 5 K, with typical values of the order of ∼1GHz. While spectral diffusion dominates at increasing pump powers, it can be minimized by working well below saturation excitation power.

In particular, we consider a donor-π bridge-acceptor dye at the gap of two Ag nanospheres. Our theoretical approach allows for a realistic description of the continua of both molecular vibrations and optical nanocavity modes. We analyze both the ultrafast exciton dynamics in the large Purcell enhancement regime and the corresponding emission spectrum, showing that these magnitudes are not accurately represented by the simplified models used up to date. Specifically, both the two-level system model and the single vibrational mode model can only reproduce the dynamics over short time scales, whereas the Fermi’s golden rule approach accounts only for the behavior at very long times. We demonstrate that including the whole set of vibrational modes is necessary to capture most of the dynamics and the corresponding spectrum. Moreover, by disentangling the coupling of the molecule to radiative and nonradiative plasmonic modes, we also shed light into the quenching phenomenology taking place in the system.},

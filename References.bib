  abstract = {Color centers in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) are emerging as a mature platform for single-photon sources in quantum technology applications. In this study, we investigate the temperature-dependent spectral properties of a single defect in hBN to understand the dominant dephasing mechanisms due to phonons. We observe a sharp zero-phonon line (ZPL) emission accompanied by Stokes and anti-Stokes optical phonon sidebands assisted by the Raman-active low-energy (≈ 6.5 meV) interlayer shear mode of hBN. The shape of the spectral lines around the ZPL is measured down to 78 K, at which the line width of the ZPL is measured as 211 μeV. Using a quadratic electron–phonon interaction, the temperature-dependent broadening and the lineshift of the ZPL are found to follow a temperature dependence of T + T5 and T + T3, respectively. Furthermore, the temperature-dependent line shape around the ZPL at low-temperature conditions is modeled with a linear electron–phonon coupling theory, which results in a 0 K Debye–Waller factor of the ZPL emission as 0.59. Our results provide insights into the underlying mechanisms of electron–phonon coupling in hBN, which is critical to enhance their potential for applications in quantum technologies.},

However, beyond the fact that it has not yet been demonstrated experimentally, its plausibility and effect on quantum bit error rate are questioned. In this work, an experimental scheme is presented for PNS attack employing demonstrated technological capabilities, specifically a single-photon Raman interaction (SPRINT) in a cavity-enhanced three-level atomic system. Several aspects of the proposed implementation are addressed, analytically and simulatively, and the eavesdropper's information gain by the attack is calculated. Furthermore, it is analytically shown that the scheme results in a small (yet non-zero) quantum bit error rate, and a comparison to purely theoretical analyses in the literature is presented. It is believed that the inherent nonlinearity of the PNS attack unavoidably affects the optical modes sent to the receiver, and accordingly will always result in some error rate.},

Moreover, pure dephasing is shown to be able to restore lasing in presence of detuning, a further demonstration that decoherence can be seen as a fundamental resource in solid-state cavity quantum electrodynamics, offering appealing perspectives in the context of advanced nanophotonic devices. We propose experimental strategies to develop a versatile device that can be operated either as a single-photon source or as a laser, based on the control by decoherence of the coupling between a single quantum dot and a solid-state cavity.},

  abstract = {Can light be spatially confined and transported in free space without angular spread? Although the wave nature of light precludes the existence of such an idealization, light can take the form of beams that come as close as possible to spatially localized and nondiverging waves. A plane wave and a spherical wave represent the two opposite extremes of angular and spatial confinement. The wavefront normals (rays) of a plane wave are parallel to the direction of the wave so that there is no angular spread, but the energy extends spatially over the entire space. The spherical wave, on the other hand, originates from a single point, but its wavefront normals (rays) diverge in all directions. Waves with wavefront normals making small angles with the z axis are called paraxial waves. They must satisfy the paraxial Helmholtz equation derived earlier. An important solution of this equation that exhibits the characteristics of an optical beam is a wave called the Gaussian beam. The beam power is principally concentrated within a small cylinder surrounding the beam axis. The intensity distribution in any transverse plane is a circularly symmetric Gaussian function centered about the beam axis. The width of this function is minimum at the beam waist and grows gradually in both directions. The wavefronts are approximately planar near the beam waist, but they gradually curve and become approximately spherical far from the waist. The angular divergence of the wavefront normals is the minimum permitted by the wave equation for a given beam width. The wavefront normals are therefore much like a thin pencil of rays. Under ideal conditions, the light from a laser takes the form of a Gaussian beam. First an expression for the complex amplitude of the Gaussian beam is derived and a detailed discussion of its physical properties (intensity, power, beam radius, angular divergence, depth of focus, and phase) is provided. The shaping of Gaussian beams (focusing, relaying, collimating, and expanding) by the use of various optical components is the subject of the next section. A family of optical beams called Hermite–Gaussian beams, of which the Gaussian beam is a member, is introduced. Laguerre–Gaussian and Bessel beams are discussed.},

In this work, multicolor radiative emissions are engineered and tailored by position-controlled low-energy electron irradiation. Varying the irradiation parameters, such as the electron beam energy and/or area dose, we are able to induce light emissions at different wavelengths in the green–red range. In particular, the 10 keV and 20 keV irradiation levels induce the appearance of broad emission in the orange–red range (600–660 nm), while 15 keV gives rise to a sharp emission in the green range (535 nm). The cumulative dose density increase demonstrates the presence of a threshold value. The overcoming of the threshold, which is different for each electron beam energy level, causes the generation of non-radiative recombination pathways.},

The wide-bandgap two-dimensional material incorporates crystal defects of yet-unknown configuration, introducing discrete energy levels with radiative transition frequencies in the visible spectral range. The commonly observed high brightness together with the moderate fluorescence lifetime indicates a high quantum efficiency, but the exact dynamics and the underlying energy level structure remain elusive. In this study we present a systematic and detailed analysis of the photon statistics recorded for several individual emitters. We extract the individual decay rates by modeling the second-order correlation functions using a set of rate equations based on an energy level scheme involving long-lived states. Our analysis clearly indicates excitation-power-dependent non-radiative couplings to at least two metastable levels and confirms a near unity quantum efficiency.},

Site positioning progress has been made in established platforms including defects in diamond and self-assembled quantum dots, albeit often with compromised coherence and optical quality. The emergence of single quantum emitters in layered transition metal dichalcogenide semiconductors offers new opportunities to construct a scalable quantum architecture. Here, using nanoscale strain engineering, we deterministically achieve a two-dimensional lattice of quantum emitters in an atomically thin semiconductor. We create point-like strain perturbations in mono- and bi-layer WSe2 which locally modify the band-gap, leading to efficient funnelling of excitons towards isolated strain-tuned quantum emitters that exhibit high-purity single photon emission. We achieve near unity emitter creation probability and a mean positioning accuracy of 120±32\,nm, which may be improved with further optimization of the nanopillar dimensions.},

Through plasmonic coupling it is possible to increase the quantum efficiency of SPEs by increasing the radiative decay rate, but to approach unity quantum efficiency, non-radiative decay must be mitigated. Here we show that non-radiative decay in two-dimensional WSe2 quantum emitters can be electrically suppressed through charge depletion by using dual gate configurations under a large electric field. In this condition, for site-controlled SPEs in WSe2 coupled to gold nanogaps, the SPE transition quantum efficiency after gating is increased to 76.4\,±\,14.6\% on average, with some SPEs reaching near-unity (more than 90\%) quantum efficiency. This study provides a new approach for tuning SPEs with an applied gate voltage and motivates further theoretical and experimental studies of SPE enhancement on vertically aligned nanogaps.},

There has been a large variety of defects being fabricated, yet, for many of them, the atomic origin remains unclear. The direct imaging of the defect is technically very challenging, in particular since, in a diffraction-limited spot, there are many defects and then one has to identify the one that is optically active. Another approach is to compare the photophysical properties with theoretical simulations and identify which defect has a matching signature. It has been shown that a single property for this is insufficient and causes misassignments. Here, we publish a density functional theory-based searchable online database covering the electronic structure of hBN defects (257 triplet and 211 singlet configurations), as well as their photophysical fingerprint (excited state lifetime, quantum efficiency, transition dipole moment and orientation, polarization visibility, and many more). All data is open-source and publicly accessible at https://h-bn.info and can be downloaded. It is possible to enter the experimentally observed defect signature and the database will output possible candidates which can be narrowed down by entering as many observed properties as possible. The database will be continuously updated with more defects and new photophysical properties (which can also be specifically requested by any users). The database therefore allows one to reliably identify defects but also investigate which defects might be promising for magnetic field sensing or quantum memory applications.},

With increasing temperature, the ��high2⁢�� mode displays strong anharmonic interactions, with a linewidth increase that indicates an important contribution of four-phonon processes and a marked frequency downshift that can be attributed to a substantial effect of the four-phonon scattering processes (quartic anharmonicity). In contrast, the ��low2⁢�� mode displays a very narrow linewidth and weak anharmonic interactions, with a frequency downshift that is primarily accounted for by the thermal expansion of the interlayer spacing.},

  abstract = {Deterministic generation of single photons is essential for many quantum information technologies. A bulk optical nonlinearity emitting a photon pair, where the measurement of one of the photons heralds the presence of the other, is commonly used with the caveat that the single-photon emission rate is constrained due to a trade-off between multiphoton events and pair emission rate. Using an efficient and low noise photon-number-resolving superconducting nanowire detector we herald, in real time, a single photon at telecommunication wavelength. We perform a second-order photon correlation ��2⁡(0) measurement of the signal mode conditioned on the measured photon number of the idler mode for various pump powers and demonstrate an improvement of a heralded single-photon source. We develop an analytical model using a phase-space formalism that encompasses all multiphoton effects and relevant imperfections, such as loss and multiple Schmidt modes. We perform a maximum-likelihood fit to test the agreement of the model to the data and extract the best-fit mean photon number �� of the pair source for each pump power. A maximum reduction of 0.118 ±0.012 in the photon ��2⁡(0) correlation function at �� =0.327 ±0.007 is obtained, indicating a strong suppression of multiphoton emissions. For a fixed ��2⁡(0) =7 ×10−3, we increase the single pair generation probability by 25\%. Our experiment, built using fiber-coupled and off-the-shelf components, delineates a path to engineering ideal sources of single photons.},

Atomically thin crystals have emerged as sources of nonclassical light; however, they perform below the state-of-the-art devices based on volume crystals. Here, we implement a bright single-photon source based on an atomically thin sheet of WSe2 coupled to a tunable optical cavity in a liquid-helium-free cryostat without the further need for active stabilization. Its performance is characterized by high single-photon purity (g(2)(0) = 4.7 ± 0.7\%) and record-high, first-lens brightness of linearly polarized photons of 65 ± 4\%, representing a decisive step toward real-world quantum applications. The high performance of our devices allows us to observe two-photon interference in a Hong–Ou–Mandel experiment with 2\% visibility limited by the emitter coherence time and setup resolution. Our results thus demonstrate that the combination of the unique properties of two-dimensional materials and versatile open cavities emerges as an inspiring avenue for novel quantum optoelectronic devices.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The out‐going wave‐front of a radiating oscillator (e. g. a Hertzian dipole) is disturbed by a reflecting surface. The resulting interference phenomenon affects the radiated power, which thus depends on the distance between oscillator and mirror. If this concept is applied to the emission of light by molecules, a dependence of the fluorescence decay time on the distance between excited molecule and mirror is to be expected.             This effect has been investigated for the case of monomolecular layers of an europium dibenzoylmethane complex, which are kept in a definite distance from an evaporated metal surface (gold, silver or aluminum) by cadmiumarachidate layers. Exciting with a flash of 366 nm light the intense red fluorescence (λ = 612 nm) of the europium ion is observed. The fluorescence follows an exponential decay law over at least two decades with a decay time of roughly 1 msec. The expected variation of the decay time with distance from the mirror is verified by the experiment. The decay time is lengthened or shortened in close agreement with the above theory, except for small distances, where energy transfer processes occur.             The mirror affects only the radiating process, while the probabilities for non‐radiating desactivation processes remain unaltered. Thus the quantum yield of fluorescence of the emitting state can be determined, which is an otherwise hardly accessible quantity.},

Here, we present the first realization of a truncated Gaussian-shaped microcavity coupled to a QD. The implementation is based on wet-chemical etching and epitaxial semiconductor overgrowth. The cavity modes and their spatial profiles are experimentally studied and agree well with simulations. The fundamental mode wavelength with Q-factors around 6000 and a small polarization splitting of 29\,μeV can be reproducibly controlled via fabrication design, enabling the adaption of the cavity to a specific QD. Finally, transitions of a QD inside a cavity are tuned on and off resonance via temperature tuning. A reduced decay time by a factor above 3 on resonance clearly indicates Purcell enhancement while second-order correlation measurements of g(2)(0)\,=\,0.057 prove that the QDs single-photon characteristic is preserved.},

  abstract = {In this review, the current landscape of emergent quantum materials for quantum photonic applications is described. The review focuses on three specific solid-state platforms: single emitters in monolayers of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), defects in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), and colloidal quantum dots in perovskites (PQDs). These platforms share a unique technological accessibility, enabling the rapid implementation of testbed quantum applications, all while being on the verge of becoming technologically mature enough for a first generation of real-world quantum applications. The review begins with a comprehensive overview of the current state-of-the-art for relevant single-photon sources in the solid-state, introducing the most important performance criteria and experimental characterization techniques along the way. Progress for each of the three novel materials is then benchmarked against more established (yet complex) platforms, highlighting performance, material-specific advantages, and giving an outlook on quantum applications. This review will thus provide the reader with a snapshot on latest developments in the fast-paced field of emergent single-photon sources in the solid-state, including all the required concepts and experiments relevant to this technology.},

  abstract = {Recently discovered quantum emitters in 2D materials have opened new prospects for integrated photonic devices for quantum information. Most of these applications require the emitted photons to be indistinguishable, which has remained elusive in 2D materials. Here we investigate two-photon interference of a quantum emitter generated in hexagonal boron nitride with use of an electron beam. We measure the correlations of zero-phonon-line photons in a Hong-Ou-Mandel interferometer under nonresonant excitation. We find that the emitted photons exhibit a partial indistinguishability of 0.44 ±0.11 in a 3-ns time window, which corresponds to a corrected value of 0.56 ±0.11 after imperfect emitter purity has been accounting for. The dependence of the Hong-Ou-Mandel visibility on the width of the postselection time window allows us to estimate the dephasing time of the emitter to be approximately 1.5 ns, about half the limit set by spontaneous emission. A visibility greater than 90\% is within reach with use of the Purcell effect with current 2D-material photonics.},

We keep track of well-identified emitters that we characterize before and after the dry transfer of exfoliated crystals. This comparison provides information about their quantum efficiency, which we find close to unity, as well as their vertical position in the crystal with nanometric precision, which we find away from the flake surfaces.

Here, we demonstrate that strain control allows spectral tunability of hBN single photon emitters over 6\,meV, and material processing sharply improves the single photon purity. We observe high single photon count rates exceeding 7\,×\,106 counts per second at saturation, after correcting for uncorrelated photon background. Furthermore, these emitters are stable to material transfer to other substrates. High-purity and photostable single photon emission at room temperature, together with spectral tunability and transferability, opens the door to scalable integration of high-quality quantum emitters in photonic quantum technologies.},

  abstract = {High-quality sources of single photons are of paramount importance for quantum communication, sensing, and metrology. To these ends, resonantly excited two-level systems based on self-assembled quantum dots have recently generated widespread interest. Nevertheless, we have recently shown that for resonantly excited two-level systems, emission of a photon during the presence of the excitation laser pulse and subsequent re-excitation results in a degradation of the obtainable single-photon purity. Here, we demonstrate that generating single photons from self-assembled quantum dots with a scheme based on two-photon excitation of the biexciton strongly suppresses the re-excitation. Specifically, the pulse-length dependence of the multi-photon error rate reveals a quadratic dependence in contrast to the linear dependence of resonantly excited two-level systems, improving the obtainable multi-photon error rate by several orders of magnitude for short pulses. We support our experiments with a new theoretical framework and simulation methodology to understand few-photon sources.},

  abstract = {Quantum dots embedded within nanowires represent one of the most promising technologies for applications in quantum photonics. Whereas the top-down fabrication of such structures remains a technological challenge, their bottom-up fabrication through self-assembly is a potentially more powerful strategy. However, present approaches often yield quantum dots with large optical linewidths, making reproducibility of their physical properties difficult. We present a versatile quantum-dot-in-nanowire system that reproducibly self-assembles in core–shell GaAs/AlGaAs nanowires. The quantum dots form at the apex of a GaAs/AlGaAs interface, are highly stable, and can be positioned with nanometre precision relative to the nanowire centre. Unusually, their emission is blue-shifted relative to the lowest energy continuum states of the GaAs core. Large-scale electronic structure calculations show that the origin of the optical transitions lies in quantum confinement due to Al-rich barriers. By emitting in the red and self-assembling on silicon substrates, these quantum dots could therefore become building blocks for solid-state lighting devices and third-generation solar cells.},

However, obtaining high photoluminescence quantum yield (PL QY), which is the key figure of merit for optoelectronics, is still challenging in the grown monolayers. Specifically, the as-grown monolayers often exhibit lower PL QY than their mechanically exfoliated counterparts. In this work, we demonstrate synthetic tungsten diselenide (WSe2) monolayers with PL QY exceeding that of exfoliated crystals by over an order of magnitude. PL QY of \textasciitilde 60\% is obtained in monolayer films grown by CVD, which is the highest reported value to date for WSe2 prepared by any technique. The high optoelectronic quality is enabled by the combination of optimizing growth conditions via tuning the halide promoter ratio, and introducing a simple substrate decoupling method via solvent evaporation, which also mechanically relaxes the grown films. The achievement of scalable WSe2 with high PL QY could potentially enable the emergence of technologically relevant devices at the atomically thin limit.},

  abstract = {Abstract Because of the strong spatial confinement of electronic wave functions and reduced dielectric screening, the effects of carrier-carrier Coulomb interactions are greatly enhanced in semiconductor nanocrystals (NCs) compared with those in bulk materials. These interactions open a highly efficient decay channel via Auger recombination, which represents a dominant recombination pathway for multiexcitons in NCs. Furthermore, strong Coulomb coupling between charge carriers leads to extremely efficient direct photogeneration of multiexcitons by single photons via carrier (or exciton) multiplication. This review focuses on spectral and dynamical properties of multiexcitons in semiconductor NCs. The specific topics discussed here include the structure of NC electronic states, spectral signatures of multiexcitons in transient absorption and photoluminescence, exciton-exciton interaction energies, Auger recombination, and carrier multiplication. This chapter also briefly reviews the implications of multiexciton effects for practical technologies, such as NC lasing and photovoltaics.},

One of the greatest challenges now is to implement the basic quantum-computational elements in a physical system and to demonstrate that they can be reliably and scalably controlled. One of the earliest proposals for quantum computation is based on implementing a quantum bit with two optical modes containing one photon. The proposal is appealing because of the ease with which photon interference can be observed. Until now, it suffered from the requirement for non-linear couplings between optical modes containing few photons. Here we show that efficient quantum computation is possible using only beam splitters, phase shifters, single photon sources and photo-detectors. Our methods exploit feedback from photo-detectors and are robust against errors from photon loss and detector inefficiency. The basic elements are accessible to experimental investigation with current technology.},

The use of realistic components, the errors they induce in the computation, and how these errors can be corrected is discussed.},

The ability to engineer the light-matter interaction strength in integrated photonic nanostructures enables a range of fundamental quantum-electrodynamics experiments on, e.g., spontaneous-emission control, modified Lamb shifts, and enhanced dipole-dipole interaction. Furthermore, highly efficient single-photon sources and giant photon nonlinearities may be implemented with immediate applications for photonic quantum-information processing. This review summarizes the general theoretical framework of photon emission including the role of dephasing processes and applies it to photonic nanostructures of current interest, such as photonic-crystal cavities and waveguides, dielectric nanowires, and plasmonic waveguides. The introduced concepts are generally applicable in quantum nanophotonics and apply to a large extent also to other quantum emitters, such as molecules, nitrogen vacancy centers, or atoms. Finally, the progress and future prospects of applications in quantum-information processing are considered.},

The temporal coherence of emitted photons (i.e. their capacity to interfere and distribute photonic entanglement) is essential for many of these applications. Hence, it is crucial to study and determine the temporal coherence of this emission under different experimental conditions. In this work, we report the coherence time of the single photons emitted by an hBN defect in a nanocrystal at room temperature, measured via Michelson interferometry. The visibility of this interference vanishes when the temporal delay between the interferometer arms is a few hundred femtoseconds, highlighting that the phonon dephasing processes are four orders of magnitude faster than the spontaneous decay time of the emitter. We also analyze the single photon characteristics of the emission via correlation measurements, defect blinking dynamics, and its Debye-Waller factor. Our room temperature results highlight the presence of a strong phonon-electron coupling, suggesting the need to work at cryogenic temperatures to enable quantum photonic applications based on photon interference.},

Consistently, the photoluminescence intensity of the emitters saturates at low excitation intensities, which is distinct to the photoluminescence of excitonic transitions in the investigated WS2 monolayers. The demonstrated method allows us to position defect emitters in WS2 monolayers on demand. A statistical analysis suggests the generation yield of individual emitters to be as high as 11\% at the highest investigated He-ion doses.},

So far, achieving isolation of individual VB– defects out of ensemble emission remains difficult due to their low quantum yield, warranting the search for other candidates. Here, we show that oxygen annealing creates individual quantum emitters characterized by a phonon-sideband-free emission in the 800 nm band. The emission is strongly linearly polarized (79\%), with a characteristic emission dipole rotation of 20° and a saturation intensity around 1 MHz, comparable to the brightest hBN quantum emitters reported previously. Their time dynamics appear free of spectral diffusion or blinking, implying excellent room-temperature photostability without additional passivation techniques. Detailed cryogenic studies estimate zero pump power line width down to 87.5 μeV, which is several orders of magnitude narrower compared to carbon-related or VB– defect center emission under nonresonant excitation. The demonstrated photophysical properties of oxygen-related quantum emitters are promising to advance free-space quantum communication and might enable indistinguishable single photons or interfacing with 87Rb vapor-based quantum memory technologies in future work.},

Among various solid-state platforms, hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) is gaining considerable interest as a compelling van der Waals host of quantum emitters. However, progress to date has been limited by an inability to engineer simultaneously an hBN emitter and a narrow-band photonic resonator at a predetermined wavelength. Here, we overcome this problem and demonstrate deterministic fabrication of hBN nanobeam photonic crystal cavities with high quality factors over a broad spectral range (∼400 to 850 nm). We then fabricate a monolithic, coupled cavity–emitter system designed for a blue quantum emitter that has an emission wavelength of 436 nm and is induced deterministically by electron beam irradiation of the cavity hotspot. Our work constitutes a promising path to scalable on-chip quantum photonics and paves the way to quantum networks based on van der Waals materials.},

Therefore, the development of decoy state protocols using weak coherent states (WCS) from lasers, set the frontier in terms of secure key rates. Here, we propose and experimentally emulate two simple-to-implement protocols that allow practical, far from ideal sub-Poissonian photon sources to outperform state-of-the-art WCS. By engineering the photon statistics of a quantum dot's biexciton-exciton cascade, we show that either a truncated decoy state protocol or a heralded purification protocol can be employed to achieve a significantly increased performance in terms of the maximal allowed channel loss for secure key creation, which can exceed that of WCS by more than 3dB. We then show that our recently demonstrated room temperature single photon sources, based on giant colloidal quantum dots coupled to nano-antennas, are already well within the optimal performance range. These protocols can be utilized efficiently on a host of various sub-Poissonian quantum emitters having controllable photon statistics, offering a practical approach to QKD without the hindering requirements on the single photon purity of the photon source.},

However, the required cryogenic temperatures for the functionality of these sources has been an inhibitor of their full potential. Existing methods to create emitters in 2D materials face fundamental challenges in extending the working temperature while maintaining the emitter’s fabrication yield and purity. In this work, we demonstrate a method of creating site-controlled single-photon emitters in atomically thin WSe2 with high yield utilizing independent and simultaneous strain engineering via nanoscale stressors and defect engineering via electron-beam irradiation. Many of the emitters exhibit biexciton cascaded emission, single-photon purities above 95\%, and working temperatures up to 150\,K. This methodology, coupled with possible plasmonic or optical micro-cavity integration, furthers the realization of scalable, room-temperature, and high-quality 2D single- and entangled-photon sources.},

While phonon-assisted excitation has shown promise in other quantum emitter platforms, its proper implementation and systematic comparison with alternative excitation schemes have not yet been demonstrated in transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) quantum emitters. Here, we investigate the impact of various optical excitation strategies on the single-photon emission properties of bilayer WSe2 quantum emitters. Based on our theoretical predictions for the exciton preparation fidelity, we compare the~excitation via the longitudinal acoustic and breathing phonon modes to conventional above-band and near-resonance excitations. Under acoustic phonon-assisted excitation, we achieve narrow single-photon emission with a reduced spectral diffusion of 0.0129 nm, a 1.8-fold improvement over above-band excitation. Additionally, excitation through breathing-phonon mode yields a high purity of 0.947~±~0.079\, and reduces the decay time by over an order of magnitude, reaching (1.33~±~0.04)\,ns.

Epitaxial quantum dots (QDs) have been made capable of on-demand photon generation with high purity, indistinguishability and brightness, although they require precise fabrication and face challenges in scalability. By contrast, colloidal QDs are batch synthesized in solution but typically have broader linewidths, low single-photon purities and unstable emission. Here we demonstrate spectrally stable, pure and narrow-linewidth single-photon emission from InP/ZnSe/ZnS colloidal QDs. Using photon correlation Fourier spectroscopy, we observe single-dot linewidths as narrow as \textasciitilde 5\,µeV at 4\,K, giving a lower-bounded optical coherence time, T2, of \textasciitilde 250\,ps. These dots exhibit minimal spectral diffusion on timescales of microseconds to minutes, and narrow linewidths are maintained on timescales up to 50\,ms, orders of magnitude longer than other colloidal systems. Moreover, these InP/ZnSe/ZnS dots have single-photon purities g(2)(τ\,=\,0) of 0.077–0.086 in the absence of spectral filtering.

  abstract = {The emergence of spatial and temporal coherence of light emitted from solid-state systems is a fundamental phenomenon intrinsically aligned with the control of light-matter coupling. It is canonical for laser oscillation, emerges in the superradiance of collective emitters, and has been investigated in bosonic condensates of thermalized light, as well as exciton-polaritons. Our room temperature experiments show the strong light-matter coupling between microcavity photons and excitons in atomically thin WSe2. We evidence the density-dependent expansion of spatial and temporal coherence of the emitted light from the spatially confined system ground-state, which is accompanied by a threshold-like response of the emitted light intensity. Additionally, valley-physics is manifested in the presence of an external magnetic field, which allows us to manipulate K and K’ polaritons via the valley-Zeeman-effect. Our findings validate the potential of atomically thin crystals as versatile components of coherent light-sources, and in valleytronic applications at room temperature.},

Semiconductor quantum dots inserted into photonic structures are ultrabright single-photon sources, yet the indistinguishability is limited by charge noise. Parametric downconversion sources provide highly indistinguishable photons but are operated at very low brightness to maintain high single-photon purity. To date, no technology has provided a bright source generating near-unity indistinguishability and pure single photons. Here, we report such devices made of quantum dots in electrically controlled cavities. Application of an electrical bias on the deterministically fabricated structures is shown to strongly reduce charge noise. Under resonant excitation, an indistinguishability of 0.9956\,±\,0.0045 is demonstrated with g(2)(0)\,=\,0.0028\,±\,0.0012. The photon extraction of 65\% and measured brightness of 0.154\,±\,0.015 make this source 20 times brighter than any source of equal quality. This new generation of sources opens the way to new levels of complexity and scalability in optical quantum technologies.},

In particular, we perform temperature-resolved photoluminescence studies and measure photon coherence times from the hBN emitters. The obtained value of 81⁢(1)⁢ps translates to a width of ∼6.5GHz which is higher than the Fourier transform limited value of ∼32MHz. To account for the photodynamics of the emitter, we perform ultrafast spectral diffusion measurements that partially account for the coherence times.

  abstract = {Quantum emitters capable of producing single photons on-demand with high color purity are the building blocks of emerging schemes in secure quantum communications, quantum computing, and quantum metrology. Such solid-state systems, however, are usually prone to effects of spectral diffusion (SD), i.e., fast modulation of the emission wavelength due to the presence of localized, fluctuating electric fields. Two-dimensional materials are especially vulnerable to SD by virtue of the proximity of the emitters to the outside environment. In this study we report measurements of SD in a single hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) quantum emitter on the nanosecond to second time scales using photon correlation Fourier spectroscopy. We demonstrate that the spectral diffusion dynamics can be modeled by a two-component Gaussian random jump model, suggesting multiple sources of local fluctuations. We provide a lower limit of ∼0.13 for the ratio of the emitter’s coherence time (T2) to twice its radiative lifetime (2T1) when it is measured on submicrosecond time scales. These results suggest that attaining transform-limited line widths could be achieved with moderate enhancement of the radiative rate. Moreover, the complex SD dynamics identified in our work inspires further exploration of the dephasing mechanisms in hBN as a viable quantum emitter platform.},

In classical terms, the field of S induces A to oscillate and the induced field of A, arriving at S, slows down this oscillator. This effect may be studied, too, without A being an absorber, but simply a polarizable molecule, oscillating in phase with the radiation field of S at the location of A. Then the field which is produced by A and acting at S accelerates or slows down this oscillator depending on the phase relation to its motion; thus the decay time of the luminescence of S will be prolonged or shortened. This phase relation depends on the time needed for the propagation of the electromagnetic field from S to A and from A to S.},

We now demonstrate that individual colloidal lead halide perovskite quantum dots (PQDs) display highly efficient single-photon emission with optical coherence times as long as 80 picoseconds, an appreciable fraction of their 210-picosecond radiative lifetimes. These measurements suggest that PQDs should be explored as building blocks in sources of indistinguishable single photons and entangled photon pairs. Our results present a starting point for the rational design of lead halide perovskite–based quantum emitters that have fast emission, wide spectral tunability, and scalable production and that benefit from the hybrid integration with nanophotonic components that has been demonstrated for colloidal materials.},

Amongst them, transition-metal dichalcogenides, especially WSe2, have been one of the subjects of intensive studies. Yet, their single-photon purity and photon indistinguishability remain the most significant challenges to compete with mature semiconducting systems such as self-assembled InGaAs quantum dots. In this work, we explore the emission properties of quantum emitters in a WSe2 monolayer which are induced by metallic nanoparticles. Under quasi-resonant pulsed excitation, we verify clean single-photon emission with a g (2)(0) = 0.036 ± 0.004. Furthermore, we determine the temperature dependent coherence time via Michelson interferometry, where a value of (13.5 ± 1.0) ps is extracted for the zero-phonon line at 4 K, which reduces to (9 ± 2) ps at 8 K. Associated time-resolved photoluminescence experiments reveal a decrease of the decay time from (2.4 ± 0.1) ns to (0.42 ± 0.05) ns. This change in decay time is explained by a model which considers a Förster-type resonant energy transfer process which yields a strong temperature induced energy loss from the single-photon emitters to the nearby Ag nanoparticle.},

  abstract = {Quantum emitters in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) are emerging as bright and robust sources of single photons for applications in quantum optics. In this work we present detailed studies on the limiting factors to achieve Fourier transform limited spectral lines. Specifically, we study phonon dephasing and spectral diffusion of quantum emitters in hBN via resonant excitation spectroscopy at cryogenic temperatures. We show that the linewidths of hBN quantum emitters are phonon broadened, even at 5 K, with typical values of the order of ∼1GHz. While spectral diffusion dominates at increasing pump powers, it can be minimized by working well below saturation excitation power. Our results are important for future utilization of quantum emitters in hBN for quantum interference experiments.},

  abstract = {Ar plasma etching and annealing are highly robust in generating oxygen related single photon emitters in hBN.           ,                             Artificial atomic systems in solids are becoming increasingly important building blocks in quantum information processing and scalable quantum nanophotonic networks. Amongst numerous candidates, 2D hexagonal boron nitride has recently emerged as a promising platform hosting single photon emitters. Here, we report a number of robust plasma and thermal annealing methods for fabrication of emitters in tape-exfoliated hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) crystals. A two-step process comprising Ar plasma etching and subsequent annealing in Ar is highly robust, and yields an eight-fold increase in the concentration of emitters in hBN. The initial plasma-etching step generates emitters that suffer from blinking and bleaching, whereas the two-step process yields emitters that are photostable at room temperature with emission wavelengths greater than ∼700 nm. Density functional theory modeling suggests that the emitters might be associated with defect complexes that contain oxygen. This is further confirmed by generating the emitters               via               annealing hBN in air. Our findings advance the present understanding of the structure of quantum emitters in hBN and enhance the nanofabrication toolkit needed to realize integrated quantum nanophotonic circuits.},

  abstract = {B-centers in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) are gaining significant research interest for quantum photonics applications due to precise emitter positioning and highly reproducible emission wavelengths at 436\,nm. Here, we leverage the layered nature of hBN to directly measure the quantum efficiency (QE) of single B-centers. The defects were engineered in a 35\,nm flake of hBN using electron beam irradiation, and the local dielectric environment was altered by transferring a 250\,nm hBN flake on top of the one containing the emitters. By analyzing the resulting change in measured lifetimes, we determined the QE of B-centers in the thin flake of hBN. Additionally, we propose two approaches to quantify the QE of B-centers in thick flakes of hBN. Our results indicate that B-centers located in thin flakes can exhibit QEs higher than 40\,\%. Near-unity QEs are achievable under reasonable Purcell enhancement for emitters embedded in thick flakes of hBN, highlighting their promise for quantum photonics applications.},

  abstract = {Full inorganic cesium lead halide perovskites (IOPs) are regarded as attractive candidates for light-emitting diodes (LEDs) by their excellent luminescent conversion. However, unsatisfactory efficiency and stability are still the main drawbacks that hinder the commercialization progress of perovskite LEDs (PeLEDs). Here, we report an extremely uniform and flat CsPbBr3 film composing of self-assembly core–shell structured quantum dots (SCQDs) based on one-step precursor coating. The QDs size in the CsPbBr3 film is around 4.5 nm (smaller than the Bohr radius), which significantly confines injected carriers and leads to a ultrahigh exciton binding energy (Eb) of 198 meV. In addition, unfavorable surfacial defects are dramatically passivated by a thin surfacial-capping layer composed of long-chain ammonium groups (phenylalanine bromide, PPABr), resulting in an ultralow nonradiative recombination rate. Consequently, the CsPbBr3 SCQDs film presents a high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 85\%. It enables the resulting green PeLEDs to deliver a recorded external quantum efficiency (EQE) over 15\% with ideal operational stability. Furthermore, the developed CsPbBr3 SCQDs film also demonstrates promising potential in multifunctional lighting sources such as flexible and smart devices.},

The developed ICL exhibits high transparency, efficient charge generation/injection capability, and high robustness to resist solvent damage during deposition of the upper functional layers. With the proposed ICL, full color (red/green/blue, R/G/B) tandem QLEDs are demonstrated with extremely high current efficiency and external quantum efficiency (EQE): 17.9 cd/A and 21.4\% for B-QLEDs, 121.5 cd/A and 27.6\% for G-QLEDs, 41.5 cd/A and 23.1\% for R-QLEDs. To the best of our knowledge, these are the highest values ever reported. In addition, the EQEs of R-, G-, and B-QLEDs all exceed 21\%. The high efficiency can be well maintained over a wide range of luminance from 102 to 104 cd/m2. For example, even at a high brightness of 20\,000 cd/m2, the EQE of R-, G-, and B-QLEDs can still sustain its 96\%, 99\%, and 78\% maximum value, respectively. The demonstrated full-color tandem QLEDs, with extremely high efficiency, long operational lifetime, low roll-off efficiency, and high color purity, would be ideal candidates to bring QLEDs into the next generation of full-color displays and the solid-state lighting market.},

  abstract = {Quantum key distribution (QKD) offers a secure means of communication based on the laws of quantum physics. Despite its remarkable advancements, the current reliance of QKD on attenuated coherent (laser) light sources has imposed a fundamental limit on the secure key rate (SKR) per channel use. This constraint stems from the scarcity of single-photon components within coherent light, inherently bounded by a maximum of 1/��. Here, we report comprehensive demonstrations of single-photon-source-based high-rate QKD, surpassing the fundamental SKR limit imposed by the weak coherent light. By employing an on-demand, bright single-photon source with an efficiency of 0.71(2), coupled with narrow-bandwidth filtering and random polarization modulation, we demonstrated a field QKD trial over a 14.6(1.1) dB-loss free-space urban channel, achieving a SKR of 1.08×10−3 bits per pulse. This SKR surpasses the practical limit of weak coherent-light-based QKD by 79\%. These findings unequivocally demonstrate the superior performance of single-photon sources over weak coherent light for QKD applications, marking a pivotal stride towards realizing a global quantum internet.},

In particular, we consider a donor-π bridge-acceptor dye at the gap of two Ag nanospheres. Our theoretical approach allows for a realistic description of the continua of both molecular vibrations and optical nanocavity modes. We analyze both the ultrafast exciton dynamics in the large Purcell enhancement regime and the corresponding emission spectrum, showing that these magnitudes are not accurately represented by the simplified models used up to date. Specifically, both the two-level system model and the single vibrational mode model can only reproduce the dynamics over short time scales, whereas the Fermi’s golden rule approach accounts only for the behavior at very long times. We demonstrate that including the whole set of vibrational modes is necessary to capture most of the dynamics and the corresponding spectrum. Moreover, by disentangling the coupling of the molecule to radiative and nonradiative plasmonic modes, we also shed light into the quenching phenomenology taking place in the system.},

With a consistent testing procedure and statistically large data sets, we show that different individual detectors - even if identical in type, make, brand, etc. - behave according to fundamentally different mathematical models.

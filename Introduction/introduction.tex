This work investigates the non-resonant excitation of hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) defects at room temperature to achieve bright and pure single-photon emission. Additionally, Purcell enhancement is pursued by coupling the single-photon modes to an open Fabry-Pérot cavity.

Efficient single-photon production is critical for advancing quantum technologies, with applications ranging from enhancing measurement precision beyond classical limits \cite{Nagata2007, Vitelli2010} to enabling reliable transport and processing of analogue information in photonic circuits \cite{Bogaerts2020}. Among these applications, quantum key distribution (QKD) is the most mature, leveraging the quantum properties of single photons to detect eavesdropping attempts and create secure communication channels. 

The first QKD protocol proposed was BB84 \cite{Bennett2014}, in which Alice (the sender) transmits photons polarised in one of two bases: the rectilinear basis ($\ket{H}$, and $\ket{V}$) or the diagonal basis ($\ket{D}=(\ket{H}+\ket{V})/\sqrt{2}$, and $\ket{A}=(\ket{H}-\ket{V})/\sqrt{2}$). These states encode binary bits (0 or 1) in two mutually unbiased bases. For each photon, Bob (the receiver) randomly selects a basis for measurement (either rectilinear or diagonal) and, after detection, publicly announces which basis was used, without revealing the measured bit value. Alice and Bob then retain only the results where they chose the same basis, using them to construct a shared secret key.

If an eavesdropper (Eve) intercepts and measures a photon, she must randomly select a basis, with a \( \frac{1}{2} \) probability of choosing incorrectly. When she measures in the wrong basis, the quantum state collapses into an incorrect polarization. If she resends the photon, it remains in the wrong state with probability \( \frac{1}{2} \), introducing an error in Bob’s measurement. Alice and Bob detect Eve by comparing \( n \) bits of their shared key. The probability of Eve measuring each photon in the correct basis by chance is \( \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^n \), which decreases exponentially with \( n \), allowing security to be arbitrarily strengthened.

While BB84 is provably secure against eavesdropping in an idealised quantum setting \cite{Shor2000}, a significant weakness arises when multi-photon pulses are used instead of true single-photon sources. In such cases, Eve can exploit the photon-number splitting (PNS) attack by using a beam splitter to measure one of the transmitted photons while allowing the other to continue to Bob undisturbed. This allows her to extract information about the key without introducing detectable errors, highlighting the necessity of true single-photon sources for ensuring secure quantum communication.


\subsection{Quantifying Single-Photon Source Efficiency}

An ideal single-photon source is able to produce an individual photon on demand, such that every photon produced has identical characteristics (polarisation, spectral shape etc.). To benchmark the quality of one of these sources, three categories are assessed: Purity (P), Indistinguishability (I) and Brightness (B). The purity of a source is defined as $P=1-g^{(2)}(0)$, where $g^{(2)}(0)$ is the second order correlation function at a time delay of 0 seconds. This can be measured using a Hanbury-Brown and Twiss set up 




\subsection{TO be included somewhere}


Despite extensive efforts to engineer reliable single-photon sources (SPSs) \cite{Eisaman2011}, no simple and stable source has yet been developed with the necessary properties for practical QKD implementation. As a result, attenuated lasers are commonly used to generate weak coherent states \cite{Stucki2005}. However, these sources follow a Poissonian photon number distribution, meaning there is always a nonzero probability of emitting multi-photon pulses, leaving them vulnerable to photon-number splitting (PNS) attacks. While security-enhancing protocols, such as decoy state QKD \cite{Lo2005}, have been introduced to mitigate this risk, recent studies have demonstrated that even imperfect sub-Poissonian photon sources can outperform state-of-the-art weak coherent state lasers in secure quantum communication \cite{Ordan2024}.
